- Battle optimizer will take a given team (build in team planner?) and will determine the best card set-ups for specific goals; damage, building np gauge, crit, etc
- Battle optimizer will include the battles, and will suggest teams based off the team planner
- Team planner stored w.o accounts? Add e-mail when?
